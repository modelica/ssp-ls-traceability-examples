**Phase 3 step 3 Define Design Specification Parameters**

**Inputs:**

* **Design specification for parameters**
    * The necessary data is taken from the XY12345 DC motor data sheet.
    * The resistance value is taken at 20 degrees and after 20 minutes of operation (running-in time) (1 Ohm).
    * The brush friction at 20 degrees and after 20 min operating time (running-in time) is taken 0.007 Nm. The bearing friction is added to this value.
* **Design specification for parameter specific simulation set up**
    * No specific environment necessary.
