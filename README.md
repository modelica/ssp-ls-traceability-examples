# SSP Traceability Specification Examples

This repository contains example files for the current prototyped
draft specification for an [SSP][]-based layered standard for simulation
traceability information exchange.  Note that this specification as
well as the examples in this repository are actively being worked on and
thus subject to change without notice.

The [specification][spec] is maintained on [GitHub][github] and is
published [here][spec]. It is based on the [SSP 1.0][SSP10] standard.
